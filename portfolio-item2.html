            <p>This project creates appointments for clients who have personal training. Implementing 
               RESTful routes, and full CRUD capabilities.</p>
            <img src="img/signup.png" alt="">
            <p>We have a Signup react component that posts the user typed data for the user 
               being created (signed up) from the frontend to the Rails backend API. When 
               the user hits the Sign Up button after typing the user information, it makes 
               a POST /signup API call to the backend Rails API with the user information 
               in the request body and the user record is created and saved in the backend database.</p>
            
            <img src="img/appointmentslogin.png" alt="">
            <p>We have a Login react component that posts the user typed data for the user being 
               logged in from the frontend to the Rails backend API. When the user hits the Login 
               button after typing the user information, it makes a POST /login API call to the 
               backend Rails API with the user information in the request body and the user is 
               authenticated using their username and password. If the user types the username/password 
               wrong, then the API returns an unauthorized response.</p>
            
            <img src="img/clients.png" alt="">
            <p>We have a Clients react component that makes a fetch API call (GET /clients) to the 
               Rails backend API to fetch all the clients data that are present in the database, and 
               then displays each client in the UI. We have a Client react component to render each 
               client data in the UI. We have EDIT and DELETE buttons that give the signed in user 
               the ability to edit a client information and delete the client. When the user clicks 
               on the DELETE button, it makes a DELETE request to the Rails backend API and deletes 
               the client record from the database.</p>
            
            <img src="img/addclient.png" alt="">
            <p>We have a NewClient react component that posts the user typed data for the client being 
               created from the frontend to the Rails backend API.</p>
            
            <img src="img/editclient.png" alt="">
            <p>We have EditClient react component that fetches the current data for the client being 
               edited from the backend Rails API. And, then it lets the logged in user edit the client 
               information (e.g. name, number, email, img_url etc.). When the user hits the Submit button, 
               it makes a fetch (PATCH clients/:id) API call to the backend Rails API with the edited 
               client information in the request body and the client data is updated in the backend database accordingly.</p>

            <img src="img/appointmentscalender.png" alt="">
            <p>We have a AppointmentsContainer react component that makes a fetch API (GET /appointment) 
               call to the Rails backend API to fetch all the appointments data that are present in the 
               database, and then displays each appointment in the UI. We have an Appointment react component 
               to render each appointment data in the UI.</p>
           
            <img src="img/addappointment.png" alt="">
            <p>We have an AppointmentForm react component that posts the current data for the appointment being 
                added from the frontend to the Rails backend API. It lets the logged in user add the appointment 
                information (e.g. client name, date, and time).

                We have ClientsDropdown react component that is used inside the AppointmentForm react component 
                to display all the available clients from the Rails backend API.
                
                And, we are using Calendar component from the react-calendar library to display the calendar and 
                let the user select a date for the appointment from the calendar.
                
                We have TimeSelectDropdown react component that is used inside the AppointmentForm react component 
                to display all the available time options and selecting the time for the appointment.
                
                When the user hits the Submit button after choosing the appointment information, it makes a 
                POST /appointments API call to the backend Rails API with the appointment information in the request 
                body and the appointment record is created and saved in the backend database.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/editappointment.png" alt="">
            <p>We have EditAppointment react component that fetches the current data for the appointment being edited
               from the backend Rails API. And, then it lets the logged in user edit the appointment information 
               (e.g. client name, date, and time). When the user hits the Submit button, it makes a fetch (PATCH /appointments/:id)
               API call to the backend Rails API with the edited appointment information in the request body and the 
               appointment data is updated in the backend database accordingly. We re-used all the 3 components here inside 
               the EditAppointment react component (ClientsDropdown, Calendar and TimeSelectDropdown) that were used and 
               described in the AppointmentForm react component section above.</p>
